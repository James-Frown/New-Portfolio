                My journey into tech started after matriculating from St.
                Andrew’s College, Grahamstown. I knew I wanted to do something
                creative but also technical, which led me to study Interaction
                Design at CTCA in Cape Town.

              </h3>
              <p className="body__text">
                During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in HTML &
                CSS, learning how to structure and style web pages. I also
                explored JavaScript, which introduced me to dynamic web
                interactions and front-end development.
              </p>
              <p className="body__text">
                By the time I graduated (April 2024), I had worked on various
                projects that combined UX, UI, and interaction design. I also
                started getting comfortable with React—building reusable
                components and using React Router to create seamless navigation
                in single-page applications.

              </h3>
              <p className="body__text">
                Before diving fully into my tech career, I spent time traveling
                and experiencing life in a new environment. This period was
                eye-opening—not just in terms of personal growth, but also in
                observing how interaction design plays a role in everyday life,
                from well-designed user experiences in public spaces to
                intuitive digital interfaces in retail and hospitality.
              </p>
              <p className="body__text">
                Beyond design, this time helped me understand more about myself,
                different cultures, and how people interact with technology in
                various contexts. It reinforced my passion for creating
                intuitive, user-friendly digital experiences that improve
                people’s lives.

              <h3 className="heading__text">2024 - Leveling Up</h3>
              <p className="body__text">
                After returning, I focused heavily on advancing my technical
                skills. I took a deep dive into Next.js and TypeScript, learning
                best practices for performance, scalability, and
                maintainability. I also explored APIs and Firebase, gaining a
                better understanding of integrating backend services into my
                applications.
              </p>
              <p className="body__text">
                Right now, I’m actively working on expanding my skills through
                FreeCodeCamp, aiming to get certified while solidifying my
                knowledge in full-stack development.

              <p className="body__text">
                Looking ahead, I’m excited to expand beyond front-end
                development and truly understand the full web stack. I want to
                master Node.js, backend development, and databases, while also
                diving into Python & Django for more robust applications.
              </p>
              <p className="body__text">
                At the same time, my passion for design and interaction hasn’t
                faded. I want to explore product design and advanced UX
                principles, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in digital
                experiences. Whether it’s through coding or design, my goal is
                to create products that feel seamless, engaging, and meaningful.

                By this point, I see myself fully immersed in full-stack
                development, using my expertise in React, Next.js, TypeScript,
                and backend technologies to build dynamic, scalable
                applications. But I also want to continue refining my
                interaction design skills, experimenting with microinteractions,
                immersive experiences, and design systems to create even better
                products.

              <p className="body__text">
                I welcome both design and development opportunities, whether
                it’s freelancing, working on innovative projects, or
                contributing to open-source. My focus will be on growing as a
                developer and designer, pushing creative and technical
                boundaries, and taking on bigger challenges.
